My first C# project. I asked Chat GPT an idea for a C# beginner project and if you want to see the project outline ChatGPT gave me it is in the outline.md file.

## What I Learned

Over the past two weeks I have been focusing on learning C#. It is very similar in some ways to C++ and Java, but there have been small differences I have learned. I wanted to create a smaller project after researching and watching videos on C# to practice the language before learning ASP.NET and other C# frameworks.

This project taught me...
<ul>
        <li>C# classes</li>
        <li>Tasks or Threads</li>
        <li>LINQ queries</li>
        <li>Thread-safe collections</li>
</ul>

This project also re-familiarized me with Visual Studio as I have primarily used Visual Studio Code for the past couple of years.

I really enjoyed learning C# in a smaller project and I am excited to learn .NET next!
