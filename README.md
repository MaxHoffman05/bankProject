## Summary

I asked Chat GPT for an idea for a small C# project. Over the course of my research and coding for this project I saw a lot of similarities between C# and C++. I wanted Chat GPT to give me a smaller project that also made use of a couple C# features that I wouldnt have been aware of. My goal for this project was to get comfortable with C# and its syntax as well as learn a couple new concepts based in C#.

## What I Learned

Over the past two weeks I have been focusing on learning C#. I wanted to create a smaller project after researching and watching videos on C# to practice the language before learning ASP.NET and other C# frameworks.

This project taught me...
<ul>
        <li>C# classes</li>
        <li>C# Tasks</li>
        <li>LINQ queries</li>
        <li>Thread-safe collections</li>
</ul>

This project also re-familiarized me with Visual Studio as I have primarily used Visual Studio Code for the past couple of years.

I really enjoyed learning some features of C# in a smaller project and I am excited to learn .NET next!
